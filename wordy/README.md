Wordy
=====

Boggle is a word game where you try to find as many words as possible in a 4x4
grid. Making an efficient Boggle solver is a good programming challenge. A more
interesting problem is finding a Boggle board with the most words. One way to
solve this is with a genetic algorithm. The `wordy` program here does just
that. The dictionary included here `popular.txt` has only 25,322 words. There
are dictionaries with many more words. You can also play the game on boards of
different sizes.
